# Medical Image Segmentation, Winter in Data Science '22
Brain Tumor Segmentation &amp; Detection using Multi-modal MRI scans with U-Net Architecture

Week 1 & 2: Architecture review and research literature survey to choose problem statement and model.

Week 2: Data Pre-processing and visualization.

Week 3: Model Implementation

Week 4: Conclusion & Report

Here is the [final implementation](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/Medical-Image-Segmentation--Winter-in-Data-Science/blob/main/WIDS2.ipynb) of the segmentation model.
Here is the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation) that was used for this implementation.
Here is the [final report](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/Medical-Image-Segmentation--Winter-in-Data-Science/blob/main/WiDS%20Report.pdf).
Here is the [Week 1 summary](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/Medical-Image-Segmentation--Winter-in-Data-Science/blob/main/summary.pdf).
Here is [model 1.1](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/Medical-Image-Segmentation--Winter-in-Data-Science/blob/main/2D_firstrun.hdf5).
Here is [model 1.2](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/Medical-Image-Segmentation--Winter-in-Data-Science/blob/main/2D_secondrun.hdf5).
